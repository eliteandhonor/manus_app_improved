# LIVE WORKFLOW TRACE: Playwright Website Scanning & Credential Display (x.com)

**Date:** 2025-05-21  
**Test Case:** x.com  
**App Version:** Running from `main.py` (desktop GUI, PyQt/Tkinter)  
**Trace Performed By:** Automated live observation (console logs, no code changes)

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

This trace documents the end-to-end integration of the Playwright website scanning and credential display workflows for x.com, as observed in the running application.  
All steps, backend logic, and UI responses are traced using live logs and workflow analysis.

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Trace

### Step 1: User Initiates Login/Scan for x.com

- **Action:** User triggers login/scan for x.com in the desktop GUI.
- **Expected:** Playwright automation launches browser, navigates to x.com login, attempts Google sign-in.

---

### Step 2: Playwright Automation & Detection Logic

- **Log Output:**
  ```
  2025-05-21 20:27:35,221 - BrowserAutomation - ERROR - Error clicking Google sign-in button: ElementHandle.click: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
  Call log:
    - attempting click action
      2 × waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable
        - element is visible, enabled and stable
        - scrolling into view if needed
        - done scrolling
        - <div tabindex="0" class="L5Fo6c-bF1uUb" id="gsi_222243_121654-overlay"></div> intercepts pointer events
      - retrying click action
      - waiting 20ms
      2 × waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable
        - element is visible, enabled and stable
        - scrolling into view if needed
        - done scrolling
        - <div tabindex="0" class="L5Fo6c-bF1uUb" id="gsi_222243_121654-overlay"></div> intercepts pointer events
      - retrying click action
        - waiting 100ms
      11 × waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable
         - element is visible, enabled and stable
         - scrolling into view if needed
         - done scrolling
         - <div tabindex="0" class="L5Fo6c-bF1uUb" id="gsi_222243_121654-overlay"></div> intercepts pointer events
       - retrying click action
         - waiting 500ms
      - waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable
  ```
- **Analysis:**  
  - Playwright detection logic is invoked.
  - The automation attempts to click the Google sign-in button.
  - The click fails due to an overlay div intercepting pointer events, resulting in a timeout.
  - This prevents successful login and may block further credential retrieval/display.

### Step 3: Credential Storage

- **Log Output:**
  ```
  2025-05-21 20:27:35,224 - CredentialManager - INFO - Saved 3 credential entries
  ```
- **Analysis:**  
  - Despite the Playwright error, the credential manager attempts to save credential entries.
  - It is unclear if these credentials are valid or partial due to the failed login.
  - The data flow from Playwright → CredentialManager → storage is confirmed.

---

### Step 4: Credential Display in UI

- **Observation:**  
  - No direct log output for UI display in the provided logs.
  - If credentials are not shown in the UI, it may be due to the Playwright error or data loss in the flow.
  - The UI display logic should be checked for error handling and fallback behavior.

---

## 3. Data Flow Trace

- **User Action:** Initiates login/scan for x.com in GUI.
- **Backend:** Playwright automation runs, detection logic invoked.
- **Error:** Playwright fails to click sign-in button (overlay intercepts).
- **CredentialManager:** Attempts to save credentials (log confirms 3 entries).
- **UI:** Credential display may be incomplete or missing due to upstream error.

---

## 4. Findings & Issues

- **Playwright detection logic is called** and logs detailed errors.
- **CredentialManager is triggered** and logs credential save events.
- **UI response** may not show credentials if Playwright fails.
- **Information loss** occurs at the Playwright automation step (click error), which propagates to credential display.

---

## 5. Screenshots

*Screenshots of the GUI at each step are not available via automation.  
To complete this trace, please manually capture and add screenshots of:*
- The login/scan initiation screen for x.com.
- The UI state after Playwright error (if any error dialog or message is shown).
- The credential display area (showing credentials or error/empty state).

---

## 6. Recommendations for Further Investigation

- Review UI error handling for failed Playwright automation.
- Check if partial credentials are displayed or if the UI provides feedback to the user.
- Consider improving overlay detection/handling in Playwright scripts.
