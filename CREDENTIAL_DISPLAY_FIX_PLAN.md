# Credential Display & Playwright Website Scanning: Implementation Plan

**Objective:**  
Address all root causes and failure points identified in [`CREDENTIAL_DISPLAY_INVESTIGATION.md`](CREDENTIAL_DISPLAY_INVESTIGATION.md) for the credential display and Playwright website scanning workflow. This plan provides concrete, step-by-step actions to optimize the balance between precision and recall in detection, with rationale for each step.

---

## 1. Credential Display: Error Handling & User Guidance

### Issue
- If credentials are missing or malformed, errors are shown in the UI, but no recovery or guidance is provided.

### Steps
1. **Improve Error Messaging**
   - Update UI components to display actionable error messages when credential retrieval fails.
   - Rationale: Clear feedback helps users understand and resolve issues, reducing frustration.

2. **Provide Recovery Options**
   - Add UI options for users to retry, edit, or re-import credentials directly from the error dialog.
   - Rationale: Enables users to recover from common issues without leaving the workflow.

3. **Manual Field/Strategy Selection**
   - Allow users to manually select which fields to use or which login strategy to attempt if automatic detection fails.
   - Rationale: Provides a fallback for edge cases, improving recall without sacrificing precision.

## 2. Playwright Detection & Automation

### 2.1. Login Form Detection

#### Root Cause
- Rigid field detection: Only the first matching input fields are used, with no context or fallback.

#### Steps
1. **Contextual Field Analysis**
   - Analyze form labels, placeholders, and surrounding text to identify likely username/email and password fields.
   - Rationale: Increases precision by reducing false positives (e.g., avoids search bars) and recall by handling non-standard forms.

2. **Consider All Forms**
   - Evaluate all forms on the page, not just the first, ranking them by likelihood of being a login form.
   - Rationale: Improves recall for pages with multiple forms (e.g., registration, newsletter, login).

3. **Rule-Based/ML Field Identification**
   - Implement rule-based logic (e.g., regex on labels, proximity to "login" buttons) and consider integrating ML models for field detection.
   - Rationale: Balances precision and recall, especially for complex or dynamic forms.

4. **Fallback & User Override**
   - If automatic detection is ambiguous, prompt the user to select fields.
   - Rationale: Maintains high precision in uncertain cases.

### 2.2. Google OAuth Detection

#### Root Cause
- Heuristic detection relies on static HTML and simple heuristics, brittle against dynamic or obfuscated UIs.

#### Steps
1. **Dynamic Content Handling**
   - Wait for page scripts to finish and dynamic content to load before scanning for Google sign-in elements.
   - Rationale: Increases recall for sites that render buttons asynchronously.

2. **Interactive Element Search**
   - Use Playwright to interactively search for Google sign-in buttons after the DOM is fully loaded, including within iframes.
   - Rationale: Improves recall for complex or obfuscated UIs.

3. **Network Request Monitoring**
   - Track network requests for Google OAuth endpoints as an additional signal for the presence of Google sign-in.
   - Rationale: Boosts precision by confirming intent, reduces false positives from unrelated "google" mentions.

4. **Heuristic Refinement**
   - Refine selectors and heuristics to reduce false positives (e.g., require button context, check for clickability).
   - Rationale: Optimizes precision without sacrificing recall.

### 2.3. Login Success/Failure Detection

#### Root Cause
- Naive success criteria: Relies on URL and error message checks, not robust for modern, dynamic login flows.

#### Steps
1. **User-Specific Element Checks**
   - After login, check for the presence of user-specific elements (e.g., profile avatar, logout button).
   - Rationale: Increases precision by confirming actual login success.

2. **Site-Specific Rules**
   - For high-value or problematic sites (e.g., x.com), implement custom rules for detecting login success/failure.
   - Rationale: Maximizes both precision and recall for critical targets.

3. **Ambiguity Logging**
   - Log and surface ambiguous cases (e.g., AJAX logins, SPA flows) for manual review or user confirmation.
   - Rationale: Ensures edge cases are not silently misclassified, improving long-term accuracy.

---

## 3. Precision vs. Recall Optimization

### Principles
- **Precision**: Avoid false positives (e.g., filling the wrong form, misidentifying login success).
- **Recall**: Avoid false negatives (e.g., missing non-standard forms, dynamic buttons).

### Optimization Steps
1. **Layered Detection**
   - Use a combination of strict (high-precision) and heuristic (high-recall) checks, escalating to user input when ambiguity remains.
   - Rationale: Ensures robust handling of both standard and non-standard cases.

2. **Configurable Thresholds**
   - Allow tuning of detection thresholds (e.g., confidence scores for ML/rule-based field detection).
   - Rationale: Enables adaptation to different environments and user preferences.

3. **Continuous Evaluation**
   - Track detection outcomes and user interventions to iteratively refine heuristics and rules.
   - Rationale: Data-driven improvement of both precision and recall over time.

---

## 4. Testing & Validation

1. **Comprehensive Test Cases**
   - Develop test cases covering standard, non-standard, dynamic, and edge-case login flows (including x.com).
   - Rationale: Ensures all improvements are validated against real-world scenarios.

2. **Precision/Recall Metrics**
   - Measure and report precision and recall for each detection step before and after changes.
   - Rationale: Quantifies improvement and guides further optimization.

---

## 5. Documentation & User Support

1. **Update User Documentation**
   - Document new error messages, manual override options, and recovery workflows.
   - Rationale: Ensures users understand new features and how to resolve issues.

2. **Developer Notes**
   - Document detection logic, thresholds, and site-specific rules for maintainability.
   - Rationale: Facilitates future enhancements and onboarding.
