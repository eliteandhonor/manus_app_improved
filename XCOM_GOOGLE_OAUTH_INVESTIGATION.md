**Date:** 2025-05-21  
**Investigator:** Automated Playwright Trace  
**Scope:** Focused, site-specific investigation of the Google sign-in flow for x.com using Playwright automation.  
**Artifacts:**  
- Log: `tools/xcom_google_oauth_trace.log`
- Screenshots: `tools/step1_xcom_home.png`, `tools/step2_signin_clicked.png`
- Script: `tools/xcom_google_oauth_trace.py`

## 1. Step-by-Step Automation Trace

### 1.1 Navigation
- Navigated to [x.com](https://x.com) successfully.
- Page loaded as expected.

### 1.2 Sign-In Button
- Clicked the login/sign-in button (selector: `text=Sign in`).
- UI responded (see `step2_signin_clicked.png`).

### 1.3 Google Sign-In Button
- Attempted to click the Google sign-in button (selector: `button:has-text("Google")`).
- **Result:** Timeout after 30 seconds. Button not found.

### 1.4 Error Log
```
2025-05-21 20:37:40,978 ERROR Error during automation: Page.click: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
Call log:
  - waiting for locator("button:has-text(\"Google\")")
```

## 2. Anti-Automation, Captcha, and Multi-Step Flow Analysis

- **No explicit captcha or anti-bot challenge** was logged, but the Google sign-in button was not detected.
- Possible causes:
  - The selector may not match the actual button (dynamic content, different text, or structure).
  - The button may be rendered asynchronously or after additional user interaction.
  - Anti-automation measures (e.g., bot detection, delayed rendering, or UI obfuscation) may have prevented the button from appearing.
  - The UI may differ for automated browsers (headless/Playwright) vs. real users.

## 3. Credential Extraction and UI Update

- **Not reached:** The Google OAuth popup did not open, so credential extraction and post-login UI update could not be verified.
- No evidence of credentials being extracted or UI updating after sign-in in this trace.

---

## 4. Workflow Analysis & Root Cause

- **Workflow Blocked:** Automation was blocked at the Google sign-in button step.
- **Root Cause Hypotheses:**
  - Selector mismatch or dynamic rendering of the Google sign-in button.
  - Potential anti-automation or bot-detection measures on x.com.
  - UI state may require additional steps or user interaction before the button appears.
- **Artifacts for Review:**
  - `step1_xcom_home.png`: x.com homepage as loaded by Playwright.
  - `step2_signin_clicked.png`: UI state after clicking sign-in.
  - `xcom_google_oauth_trace.log`: Full log of actions and errors.

## 5. Recommendations for Further Investigation

- Review screenshots to confirm UI state and presence/absence of the Google sign-in button.
- Manually inspect x.com in a real browser to compare UI and element selectors.
- Consider using Playwright's non-headless mode, slower automation, or user-agent spoofing to bypass potential anti-bot measures.
- Update selectors based on actual UI structure if needed.
- Investigate for hidden captchas or JavaScript-based bot detection.
