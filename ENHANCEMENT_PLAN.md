# User-Friendly Enhancements and Safe Browser Delay Feature

## File Roles and Responsibilities

- **src/core/browser_automation.py**: Handles all browser automation, login strategies, and browser lifecycle. Will be updated to add a configurable post-login delay before closing the browser.
- **src/core/app_core.py**: Orchestrates backend logic, connects UI to browser automation and credential management. Will pass delay settings to browser automation as needed.
- **src/ui/main_window.py**: Main GUI window, manages user interaction, settings, and triggers automation. Will be updated to provide a UI for configuring the post-login delay and to display user feedback.
- **src/ui/automation_ui.py**: Automation tab UI, controls login automation and displays status. Will be updated to show status messages about the post-login delay and ensure clear user feedback.
- **src/utils/config_manager.py**: Manages application settings. Will be updated to store and retrieve the post-login delay setting.
- **tests/**: Contains test coverage for core and utility modules. Will be reviewed and expanded to cover the new delay feature and any UI/UX changes.

## Planned Enhancements

1. **Configurable Post-Login Browser Delay**
   - Add a `post_login_delay` setting (default: 5 seconds) to `src/utils/config_manager.py`.
   - Update `src/core/browser_automation.py` to wait for this delay after successful login before closing the browser.
   - Update `src/ui/main_window.py` to allow users to configure this delay in the settings menu.
   - Update `src/ui/automation_ui.py` to display a status message during the waiting period.

2. **User-Friendly Enhancements**
   - Ensure all dialogs and forms use consistent, modern styling.
   - Add tooltips/help for complex fields and clear error/success messages.
   - Improve accessibility (keyboard navigation, color contrast, ARIA labels).
   - Provide clear status updates during login and before browser closes.

3. **Code Safety and Validation**
   - Scan all files for references to updated logic and update as needed.
   - Run all tests and expand coverage for new features.
   - Perform static analysis and manual review to ensure no code is broken.

```

## Next Steps

- Confirm this plan or suggest changes.
- Once approved, proceed to implementation in code mode.

This plan is based on a thorough understanding of each relevant file and their interactions.
